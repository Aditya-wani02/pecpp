C++ PE/COFF parsing and manipulation library 

## Inspiration / Prior Work

This project developed out of my own need for a tool handy in both PE/COFF parsing and manipulation (e.g. adding sections, modifying headers, etc.)

There are several open source attempts at comprehensive PE/COFF parsing libraries, but to my knowledge none of them are modern C++ or equipped with PE/COFF manipulation utillities. Some of theser are:
